# Dynamic concurrency group that uses the workflow name and PR number if available
# or commit SHA as a fallback. If a new build is triggered under that
# concurrency group while a previous build is running it will be canceled.
# Repeated pushes to a PR will cancel all previous builds, while multiple
# merges to main will not cancel.
# Note we add the prefix `a11y-` to avoid race conditions when called from other workflows
# for example when called from the CI workflow
