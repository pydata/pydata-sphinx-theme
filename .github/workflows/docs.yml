# This workflow is checks that the documentation can be built across multiple OSes,
# Python, and Sphinx versions.
# It also checks for broken links in the documentation and runs Lighthouse audits
# on the built site.
# IMPORTANT: if you make changes to this workflow, you will need to open a follow-up
# PR after merge to update the action SHA in the publish workflow
