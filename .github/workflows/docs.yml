# This workflow is checks that the documentation can be built across multiple OSes,
# Python, and Sphinx versions.
# It also checks for broken links in the documentation and runs Lighthouse audits
# on the built site.
# IMPORTANT: if you make changes to this workflow, you will need to open a follow-up
# PR after merge to update the action SHA in the publish workflow

# Dynamic concurrency group that uses the workflow name and PR number if available
# or commit SHA as a fallback. If a new build is triggered under that
# concurrency group while a previous build is running it will be canceled.
# Repeated pushes to a PR will cancel all previous builds, while multiple
# merges to main will not cancel.
# Note we add the prefix `docs-` to avoid race conditions when called from other workflows
# for example when called from the CI workflow
