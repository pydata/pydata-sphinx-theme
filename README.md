## Installation and usage

The theme is available on PyPI and conda-forge. You can install
and use as follows:

- Install the `pydata-sphinx-theme` in your doc build environment:

  ```
  pip install pydata-sphinx-theme
  # or
  conda install pydata-sphinx-theme --channel conda-forge
  ```

- Then, in the `conf.py` of your sphinx docs, you update the `html_theme`
  configuration option:

  ```
  html_theme = "pydata_sphinx_theme"
  ```

And that's it!

> **Note**
> This theme may not work with the latest major versions of Sphinx, especially
> if they have only recently been released. Please give us a few months of
> time to work out any bugs and changes when new releases are made.
