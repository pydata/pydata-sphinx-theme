Using ``nox``
=============

Here are a few extra tips for using ``nox``.

.. seealso::

    The `nox command line documentation <https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/usage.html>`__ has a lot of helpful tips for extra functionality you can enable with the CLI.

Re-install dependencies
-----------------------

To re-execute the installation commands, use this pattern:

.. code-block:: console

    nox -s docs -- reinstall

Or to completely remove the environment generated by ``nox`` and start from scratch:

.. code-block:: console

    rm -rf .nox/docs

Use ``nox`` with your global environment
----------------------------------------

If you'd like to use ``nox`` with your **global** environment (the one from which you are calling ``nox``), you can do so with:

.. code-block:: console

    nox --force-venv-backend none

alternatively:

.. code-block:: console

    nox --no-venv

Using ``none`` will re-use your current global environment.
See `the nox documentation <https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/usage.html#forcing-the-sessions-backend>`__ for more details.
