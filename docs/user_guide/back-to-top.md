# Back to Top button

The `Back to Top` button is a floating button that appears when you scroll down a page, and allows users to quickly return to the top of the page.

To control the visibility of the `Back to Top` button, you can use the `html_theme_options["back_to_top_button"]` configuration value in your `conf.py` file.

```python
html_theme_options = {
    "back_to_top_button": False,
}
```

The default value for this configuration option is `True`.
