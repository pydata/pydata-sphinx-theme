# Accessibility

Creating and publishing content that does not exclude disabled users is a complex and iterative task.

While there is no one-size-fits-all solution to maintaining accessible content,
the PyData Sphinx Theme and this documentation site use some techniques to avoid common content shortcomings.

:::{note}
Issues and pull requests to identify or fix accessibility issues on this theme or site are heartily welcomed!
:::

## What We've Done

### Metadata

Several of our documentation pages contain metadata (i.e., `.. meta::` directives
in reStructuredText) giving summaries of the page contents. If you notice a
page that lacks metadata, please open a pull request to add it!

### Colors

- Our default code highlighting styles are `a11y-high-contrast-light` and
  `a11y-high-contrast-dark` from https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/accessible-pygments.
  These styles are designed to meet WCAG 2 AA or AAA contrast requirements.
  If you don't like the look of our default code highlighting styles, there are several more
  to choose from at https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/accessible-pygments.
- We recently revisited the PyData Sphinx theme color palette to ensure that
  the colors we use meet WCAG 2 AA or AAA contrast requirements.
- We also re-defined our `primary` and `secondary` colors to be more accessible and distinct from semantic colors used
  to denote success, warning, info, and danger contexts or information.
- We simplified the color palette and removed some colors that were problematic in meeting WCAG 2 AA or AAA contrast requirements
  and for certain types of colorblindness.
- We have improved how we assign text colors to interactive elements such as buttons and dropdowns to ensure that they meet
  WCAG 2 AA or AAA contrast requirements.

## What You Can Do

### Site configuration

The following sections include recommendations for settings in the `conf.py` file that can positively impact the
accessibility of content generated by this theme and Sphinx in general.

### Natural Language

If not using a more robust [internationalization approach](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/advanced/intl.html),
specifying at least the baseline natural language will help assistive technology
identify if the content is in a language the reader understands.

:::{hint}
In your `conf.py` file, [specifying the language your docs are written in](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-language) will propagate to the top-level `HTML` tag.

```python
  language = "en"
```

### Add a Site Map

Site maps, usually served from a file called `sitemap.xml` are a broadly-employed
approach to telling programs like search engines and assistive technologies where
different content appears on a website.

If using a service like [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.com), these files
will be created for you _automatically_, but for some other approaches below,
it's handy to generate a `sitemap.xml` locally or in CI with a tool like
[sphinx-sitemap](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-sitemap/).

:::{hint}

For a simple site (no extra languages or versions), ensure `sphinx-sitemap`
is installed in your documentation environment, and modify your `conf.py`:

```python
    extensions += ["sphinx_sitemap"]

    html_baseurl = os.environ.get("SPHINX_HTML_BASE_URL", "http://127.0.0.1:8000/")
    sitemap_locales = [None]
    sitemap_url_scheme = "{link}"
```

### Logo best practices

If you use both light and dark themes, it's best to provide a logo that works well in both or to provide an alternative for the dark theme.
If you have a logo, you can add alt-text to it by adding the following to your
`conf.py`:

```python
  "logo": {
      "text": "PyData Theme",
      "image_dark": "_static/logo-dark.svg",
      "alt_text": "PyData Theme home",
  },
```

Note the use of "home" in the alt text to indicate that the logo is also a link to the home page.

### In the Browser

Several in-browser tools exist for interactively debugging the accessibility
of a single page at a time and can be useful during the content development cycle.

### Built-in tools

Most major browsers, including [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Accessibility_inspector)
and [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/accessibility/reference),
have accessibility tools built-in as part of their web developer tools.
These tools can help to quickly identify accessibility issues and often include links to standards.

#### tota11y

[tota11y](https://khan.github.io/tota11y/#Installation) is an open source
"bookmarklet" which modifies the currently-loaded page in place and highlights
several accessibility issues.

#### WAVE

[WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) is a proprietary (but _gratis_)
browser extension which can highlight multiple issues.

:::{warning}
Note that automated testing and extensions such as the ones mentioned above will at best catch 30-40% of accessibility issues.
They are not a replacement for manual testing and having a perfect score on any of these tools does not mean that
the site can be used by disabled users but instead signals that it follows some accessibility best practices.
:::

### In Continuous Integration

Several automated tools are available for assessing _glaring_ accessibility
issues across some pages at once, usually with many configurable options.

#### Lighthouse

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) provides an automated assessment of basic accessibility issues in addition to search engine
automation, page performance, and other best practices.

:::{hint}
Specifically, [foo-software/lighthouse-check-action](https://github.com/foo-software/lighthouse-check-action)
is run on selected pages from the generated documentation site.
