Accessibility
*************

Creating and publishing content that does not exclude audiences with limited abilities
of various kinds is challenging, but also important, to achieve and then maintain.

While there is no one-size-fits-all solution to maintaining accessible content, this
theme and documentation site use some techniques to avoid common content shortcomings.

.. Note::

    Issues and pull requests to identify or fix accessibility issues on this theme
    or site are heartily welcomed!


What We've Done
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Metadata
========

Several of our documentation pages contain metadata (i.e., ``.. meta::`` directives
in reStructuredText) giving brief summaries of the page contents. If you notice a
page that lacks metadata, please open a pull request to add it!


Colors
======

Our default code highlighting styles are ``a11y-high-contrast-light`` and
``a11y-high-contrast-dark`` from https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/accessible-pygments.
These styles are designed to be more accessible to users with limited visual abilities.
If you don't like the look of our default code highlighting styles, there are several more
to choose from at https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/accessible-pygments.


What You Can Do
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Configuration
================

Some minor configuration options in a site's ``conf.py`` can impact the
accessibility of content generated by this theme, and Sphinx in general.


Natural Language
----------------

If not using a more robust `internationalization approach <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/advanced/intl.html>`__,
specifying at least the baseline natural language will help assistive technology
identify if the content is in a language the reader understands.

.. Hint::

    Specifying a ``language`` will propagate to the top-level `html` tag.

    .. code-block:: python

        language = "en"


Add a Site Map
--------------

Site maps, usually served from a file called `sitemap.xml` are a broadly-employed
approach to telling programs like search engines and assistive technologies where
different content appears on a website.

If using a service like `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.com>`__, these files
will be created for you *automatically*, but for some of the other approaches below,
it's handy to generate a `sitemap.xml` locally or in CI with a tool like
`sphinx-sitemap <https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-sitemap/>`__.

.. Hint::

    For a simple site (no extra languages or versions), ensure `sphinx-sitemap`
    is installed in your documentation environment, and modify your ``conf.py``:

    .. code-block:: python

        extensions += ["sphinx_sitemap"]

        html_baseurl = os.environ.get("SPHINX_HTML_BASE_URL", "http://127.0.0.1:8000/")
        sitemap_locales = [None]
        sitemap_url_scheme = "{link}"


In Your Source
==============


.. Note::

    Stay tuned for more ideas here as we learn more working on this site!

In the Browser
==============

A number of in-browser tools exist for interactively debugging the accessibility
of a single page at a time, and can be useful during the content development cycle.


Built-in tools
--------------


Most major browsers, including `Firefox <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Accessibility_inspector>`__
and `Chrome <https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/accessibility/reference>`__
include significant accessibility tooling in their development experience. Exploring
these, and the modes they offer, can help to quickly pinpoint issues, and often
include links to standards.


tota11y
-------

`tota11y <https://khan.github.io/tota11y/#Installation>`__ is an open source
"bookmarklet" which modifies the currently-loaded page in-place, and highlights
a number of accessibility issues.


WAVE
----

`WAVE <https://wave.webaim.org/extension/>`__ is a proprietary (but *gratis*)
browser extension which can highlight a large number of issues.


In Continuous Integration
=========================

A number of automated tools are available for assessing *glaring* accessibility
issues across a number of pages at once, usually with many configurable options.


Lighthouse
----------

`Lighthouse <https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse>`__, which provides
automated assessment of basic accessibility issues in addition to search engine
automation, page performance, and other best practices.


.. Hint::

    Specifically, `foo-software/lighthouse-check-action <https://github.com/foo-software/lighthouse-check-action>`__
    is run on selected pages from the generated documentation site.
