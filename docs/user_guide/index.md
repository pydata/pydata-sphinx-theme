# User Guide

You can configure the behavior, look, and feel of the theme in many ways.
The remaining pages in the user guide cover various ways of doing so.

```{danger}
This theme is still under active development, and we make no promises
about the stability of any specific HTML structure, CSS variables, etc.
Make these customizations at your own risk, and pin versions if you're
worried about breaking changes!
```

There are a number of options for configuring your site's look and feel.
All configuration options are passed with the `html_theme_options` variable in your `conf.py` file.
This is a dictionary with `key: val` pairs that you can configure in various ways.
