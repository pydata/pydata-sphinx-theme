# Blogs with `ABlog`

The [ABlog extension](https://ablog.readthedocs.io/) allows you to tag pages as **blog posts** and additionally include them in landing pages for your blog.
It also has a number of sidebar templates to show off collections of your posts.

This theme has styling support for ABlog, and demonstrates some of its functionality here.
