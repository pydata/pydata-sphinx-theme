# Keyboard shortcuts

## Trigger the search bar

You can trigger the search bar pop-up with {guilabel}`ctrl`/{guilabel}`cmd` + {guilabel}`K`.

## Change pages

By default, you can move to the previous/next page using the {octicon}`arrow-left` and {octicon}`arrow-right` keys on a keyboard.
To disable this behavior, use the following configuration:

.. code-block:: python

html_theme_options = {
"navigation_with_keys": False
}
