=======================
The PyData Sphinx Theme
=======================

A clean, Bootstrap-based Sphinx theme from the PyData community.
This theme is designed for more complex documentation that breaks into natural sub-sections.

It puts all top-level pages in your ``toctree`` into the header navigation bar.
The sidebar will be populated with second-level pages when a top-level page is active.
This allows you to group your documentation into sub-sections without cluttering the sidebar.

This site is a guide for using the theme, and a demonstration for how it looks with various
elements.
