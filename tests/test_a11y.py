# library called Axe-core, which checks the page for accessibility violations,
# such as places on the page with poor color contrast that would be hard for
# people with low vision to see.
#
# Just because a page passes the scan with no accessibility violations does
# *not* mean that it will be generally usable by a broad range of disabled
# people. It just means that page is free of common testable accessibility
# pitfalls.
